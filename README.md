# HingeButtonTest
Quick prototype for hinged buttons comissioned by Road To VR. 

Our goal with this test was to make a hand tracking button designed around a 'flicking' affordance rather than a 'pushing' one, since the lack of haptics with hand tracking often results in users 'pulling back' too soon when trying to press pushable buttons.
