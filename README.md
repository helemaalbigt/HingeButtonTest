# Hinge Button Prototype
Quick prototype for hinged buttons comissioned by Road To VR. 

Our goal with this test was to make a hand tracking button designed around a 'flicking' affordance rather than a 'pushing' one, since the lack of haptics with hand tracking often results in users 'pulling back' too soon when trying to press pushable buttons.


This prototype was put together in half a day and has plenty of room for improvement:
* the current system for registering button presses doesn't work very well with fast moving fingers or when fingers come down on the edge of a button. 
* the "flip" reaction of the hinge buttons is a canned animation, but making them physics based could allow for interesting additional functionality like long presses, which could be usefull for things like holding down the backspace key in the numpad demo to delete all numbers in one go.
